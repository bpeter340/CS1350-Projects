## Bin Search Tree

###### Bin Search Tree Objective

Implement a binary search tree which can be traversed using the three main traversal methods. The input for this tree should be read in from a text file.

- [x] Preoder Traversal
- [x] Inorder Traversal
- [x] Postorder Traversal

Additional functionality I gave to this application was the ability of the user to choose the amount of leaves the tree contained.
